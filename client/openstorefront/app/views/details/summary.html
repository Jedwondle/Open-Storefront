							<b>Component Functionality:</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>{{details.name}} is a Java-based API (application programmerâ€™s interface) that was developed to reduce the time, cost, & effort associated with the creation of computer visualization applications.  JView provides the programmer with the ability to quickly develop 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional visualization applications that are tailored to address a specific problem.
								</li>
								<li>Major technologies used: Java, JOGL, OpenGL.</li>
								<li>JView is used by numerous developers from the DOD and DOD contractors.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

							<b>Evaluation Highlights:</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>JView seems very stable</b>. We could not get it to crash unexpectedly. The stability is good, but letting the user know what error is happening is not so good (see the next question).</li>
								<li><b>The documents are clear to understand</b>. The main documentation help is the demobrowser application, which has descriptions, source code and runnable examples of over 120 different uses of the API.</li>
								<li><b>The original developers do not have the resources to support the asset</b> as an enterprise asset. They will continue to support questions through forge.mil as they always have and respond as able.</li>
							</ul>

							<b>ID2E Summary:</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							JView was found to be a very useful and an easy tool to use.  Getting started is easy because of the demobrowser application which has 120+ application examples that include a full description, source code, and a run-able sample application.  The source code can be copied verbatim to create an application quickly, or modified to whatever extent the developer desires. The samples include everything from creating a basic universe and 3D graph, shaders, creating any type of models, capturing animation, geographical visualization, and many more possibilities.  It is a very extensive tool and easy to put to use.  However, some of the evaluation aspects that could receive a high evaluation fall short.
